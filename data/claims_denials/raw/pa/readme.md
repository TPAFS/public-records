_Notes:_ 

- Requested claims data from 2022 was not provided as claims from that plan year were still pending
and under review at the time of the request. As such, they were exempt from disclosure and not
considered public records at the time of request. We expect a subsequent request later this year
will furnish those records; we will update this repository accordingly at that time.

- Requested claims data from plan years 2013 to 2019 were unable to be furnished in response
to the request. Pennsylvania utilized the federal marketplace at that time, so the records
were unavailable to the agency reviewing the request.

- Requests for _all_ plan data, including non-marketplace plans, were not fully honored,
as the department did not have access to all such data. The response to the records request
made clear that the issuer level data provided in these records corresponds to a population
of marketplace plans and _may_ also correspond to non-marketplace plans. The plan level data,
on the other hand, only corresponds to marketplace plans.
