## Notes

- Requested claims data from 2022 was not provided as claims from that plan year were still pending
and under review at the time of the request. As such, they were exempt from disclosure and not
considered public records at the time of request. We expect a subsequent request later this year
will furnish those records; we will update this repository accordingly at that time.

- Requested claims data from plan years 2013 to 2019 were unable to be furnished in response
to the request. Pennsylvania utilized the federal marketplace at that time, so the records
were unavailable to the agency reviewing the request. While Pennsylvania continued to use the federal
marketplace until the end of 2020, plan year 2020 (federal) marketplace data pertaining to plans sold in PA 
appears to have been reported to the Department of Insurance and released as part of this records request.

- Requests for _all_ plan data, including non-marketplace plans, were not fully honored,
as the department did not have access to all such data. The response to the records request
made clear that the issuer level data provided in these records corresponds to a population
of marketplace plans and _may_ also correspond to non-marketplace plans. The plan level data,
on the other hand, only corresponds to marketplace plans.


## Disclaimer

The records in _this_ subdirectory are [_public records_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_records).
To our knowledge, the records have not been modified or altered in any way, and 
were graciously provided as-is by the PA Insurance Department. That department is _not_
responsible for any findings, manipulations or alterations of this data. In particular,
formulations of this data that we may standardize or adapt from these raw pdfs to
make them more user-friendly for consumption by automated processes is in no way vetted
or validated by that department, or guaranteed to be consistent with the original data;
any errors resulting from such processes are our own, and not those of the PA Department of Insurance.


# Parsed Data

The raw data provided in the public records comes from tables in PDF files (one for each issuer).
The data is inconvenient to work with in this format, for various reasons, and the matter
is made even less convenient because the tables appear to be split across pdf pages. In order to analyze
this data, we've scraped it from the pdf files and housed it in two centralized csvs: one for issuer-level
information, and one for plan-level information. These parsed data are _not_ public records,
and were not provided by any official entity: trust them at your own risk, or validate for yourself that they
were parsed correctly.

<button><a href="./processed/plans.csv" download>Download Plan Level Parsed Data</a></button>

In the future, we will house the script used to parse the data from these pdfs in this repo.
For now, we just provide the parsed data, since the schema for the output standard that we want to support
long term is still being developed.
