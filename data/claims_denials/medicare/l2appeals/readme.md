title: Medicare Level 2 Appeals

# Background

The records in this subdirectory were provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
in response to a federal [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov/) request submitted to the agency. This public records request
was granted only in part, and the partial denial is the subject of an open appeal; many pieces of data included in the request were not provided.

# Raw Data

The data in the [data/claims_denials/medicare/l2appeals/raw](https://github.com/TPAFS/public-records/tree/main/data/claims_denials/medicare/l2appeals/raw) subdirectory consists of excel spreadsheets, exactly as they were obtained from CMS. They include information about level 2 Medicare appeals for Part C and Part D from plan years 2015 to 2019.
